took
the
trail.

They
had
travelled
little
more
than
a
hundred
yards,
when
Henry,
who
was
in
front,
bent
down
and
picked
up
something
with
which
his
snowshoe
had
collided.
It
was
dark,
and
he
could
not
see
it,
but
he
recognised
it
by
the
touch.
He
flung
it
back,
so
that
it
struck
the
sled
and
bounced
along
until
it
fetched
up
on
Bill's
snowshoes.

"Mebbe
you'll
need
that
in
your
business,"
Henry
said.

Bill
uttered
an
exclamation.
It
was
all
that
was
left
of
Spanker
-
the
stick
with
which
he
had
been
tied.
